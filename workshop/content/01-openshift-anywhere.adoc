=== Introduction

Hi, I'm <name>, <role> in <organization>

In this demo we're going to do the installation of the OpenShift Container Platform to act as a basis for a new OCP fleet across cloud provders.
Coming soon, we'll be establishing this basis on-premises with VMware Vsphere as the virtual infrastructure.

We'll start with deploying a user provisioned infrastructure by hand from the command line, and add Advanced Cluster Manager to that UPI on-premises cluster.
Then we'll use ACM to deploy installer provisioned infrastructure in AWS.

In the next demo segment we'll get into the managed OpenShift services.

Before we dive in, I do want to point out we do have full stack automation using IPI on the left, which is kind of an opinionated best practices for cluster provisioning.

Although the majority of our installation is actually still follow a preexisting infrastructure, the box in the middle.

When you get into a data center there's a lot of existing, very heterogeneous infrastructure, hardware, networking and those sorts of things that need to be supported.

And so we need to meet customers where they are today in their infrastructure and be able to support that with user provision infrastructure.

And then you could see all the hosted offerings on the right, which we'll go into in further demos.

=== Pre-Existing Infrastructure Installation

So with that, let's go over to the pre-existing infrastructure installation.

We're going to start where most of our sysadmins, an OpenShift admins will be familiar, and that is at the command line.

==== Customizing Your Installation

Let's connect to the Linux command line of our internal Hub cluster where we normally create more OpenShift clsuters.

[source, bash]
----
ssh %aws_hub_provision_data.bastion_ssh_user_name%@%aws_hub_provision_data.bastion_public_hostname%
----
NOTE: password: %aws_hub_provision_data.bastion_ssh_password%
[subs=attributes]
++++
<a href="#" onclick="parent.send_to_terminal('ssh %aws_hub_provision_data.bastion_ssh_user_name%@%aws_hub_provision_data.bastion_public_hostname%', 1); return false;">Run it!</a>
++++

So I have a environment here, a Linux shell.
I want to show you what it looks like to actually deploy via UPI, user provision infrastructure.
You're going to notice a few things.

I have them install config dot YAML file here.
It was produced by running our first command and answering some basic questions about the environment.

// . Step 1: Open your OpenShift Console URL link:{openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Console].

[source, subs="attributes", bash]
----
openshift-install create install-config --dir $HOME/cluster-{guid}
----
[subs=attributes]
++++
<a href="#" onclick="parent.send_to_terminal('openshift-install create install-config --dir $HOME/cluster-{guid}', 1); return false;">Run it!</a>
++++

It's also available in rich detail in the OpenShift documentation, for all the many infrastructures we support.
This is really the majority of what the installation gets powered off of.
So this install config YAML file had some details in it.

[source, subs="attributes", bash]
----
cat $HOME/cluster-{guid}/install-config.yaml
----
[subs=attributes]
++++
<a href="#" onclick="parent.send_to_terminal('cat $HOME/cluster-{guid}/install-config.yaml', 1); return false;">Run it!</a>
++++

This is probably the most challenging part to setup is this install config YAML file and get it correct.
You need to talk to various teams like in this case, we're deploying on AWS, your administrators, your networking team, your DNS team, and so on to understand and coordinate with them what you can use inside those environments to deploy your OpenShift cluster.

==== Running the Installer

Once I have that install config, it's pretty straightforward.

So this second step your're just going to run the various commands to OpenShift installer,

I run

+
[source, subs="attributes", bash]
----
# openshift-install create cluster --dir $HOME/cluster-{guid}
----
[subs=attributes]
++++
<a href="#" onclick="parent.send_to_terminal('openshift-install create cluster --dir $HOME/cluster-{guid}', 1); return false;">Run it!</a>
++++

All I do is really just wait.
Behind the scenes, the OpenShift installer will create a Bootstrap VM for the cluster by gathering all the resources necessary to do the install.
Then it will use that Bootstrap to install the various components, and wait for OpenShift to finish installing itself.
When the OpenShift API is available, the installer will output the information we need to access the cluster.

It takes roughly 20 minutes for this to complete.

=== Finishing the Installation

Rather than wait for that, this other window here, we have the output from another installation when complete.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
tail $HOME/cluster-{aws_dev_a_provision_data.guid}/openshift-installation.log
----
[subs=attributes]
++++
<a href="#" onclick="parent.send_to_terminal('tail $HOME/cluster-{aws_dev_a_provision_data.guid}/openshift-installation.log', 1); return false;">Run it!</a>
++++

So you can see here, it's given you credentials and URLs to access the cluster.

Just copy the paste the URL, and login with the credentials, and you're in the Web Console.

And you can see, if I go to the administrator persona, this cluster is now running, and was deployed by a user provision infrastructure.

As we we're showing in our demo, we want to make this a RHACM hub cluster so we can deploy subsequent clusters.

We can deploy subsequent clusters using ACM by IPI makes it much easier.

---

To install RHACM on thsi cluster, you can just go to Operator hub, click on Advanced cluster management kubernetes and install this operator.

And this will take about two to three minutes install.

Once it's installed, then it'll become a hub cluster that can be used to deploy additional clusters.

---

For the sake of the demo, let me go ahead and just go into another RHACM that's ready.

If I go to ACM, you'll notice that when you come in you get the dashboard view.

This is advanced cluster management.

You'll go to the clusters menu on the left-hand side here.
And you can actually create a new cluster straight from here.
So once you have OpenShift deployed by UPI, made that a hub cluster, you go into Advanced cluster management.
You can begin creating clusters straight from here.

---

First you should validate that we have credentials for AWS.
And yes, they're set up.

---
So I'll go ahead and hit Create cluster.
In this case, I'm going to use AWS.
Let's go ahead and select the AWS infrastructure provider.
We'll call this New York.

If wanted to, I could add this to a cluster set.
ClusterSets are basically just a grouping for management purposes and ACM.

I'm going to select the latest release.

I'm not going to do single node OpenShift today.

Under node pools, I can customize the sizes and the accounts of my control of my worker nodes as well as their memory and CPU cores sockets, all that stuff.

I'm going to leave those as is.

You need the API that, that's the virtual IP address that the cluster will communicate over.

And that's the Ingress virtual IP address for traffic.

I'm not going to use a proxy.

If I wanted to, I could extend this installation with ansible templates.
That is, if there's something outside of the installer, outside of IPI, the installer provision infrastructure flow that I want to do, update a CMDB, send an e-mail integrated service, something of that sort.
I could use Ansible to do that.

And then I can simply review this and then hit Create.

---

Before I hit Create, I just want to point out all of this is actually see this all in YAML as well, here on the right hand side.

So if you wanted to edit this, copy and paste them and reproduce these configurations, you could do so relatively easily,

You'll hit Create.

And this will kick off and begin deploying our cluster.
So you've got the view here.
But hopefully that gives you a good idea of how you can deploy clusters using UPI, an IPI.

That completes this demonstration.

In the next demonstration, we're going to walk you through the deployment of an actual Red Hat OpenShift service on Amazon Web Services, comparing ROSA - Red Hat OpenShift on AWS, and EKS, the AWS provided Kubernetes infrastructure.
